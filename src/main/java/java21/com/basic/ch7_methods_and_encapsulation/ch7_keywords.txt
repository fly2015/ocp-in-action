Method signature: method name and input parameters

The order that Java uses to choose the right overloaded method
	1. Exact match by type
	2. Larger primitive type
	3. Autoboxed type 
	4. Varargs

can convert a primitive to larger primitive	or autobox it.
can not convert a smaller primitive to an autobox version of the larger type. 
if a variable is not a primitive, it is an Object

Encapsulation means only methods in the class with the variables can refer to the instance variables.
(A state's of object should be changed by operation inside that object)
- accessor method or a getter
- a mutator method or a setter

- remember that data (an instance variable) is private and getters/setters are public.
