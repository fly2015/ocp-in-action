INTRODUCING ABSTRACT CLASSES
- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods.
- as part of theinstantiation of a nonabstract subclass.
- An abstract method is a method that does not define an implementation when it is declared\
- An abstract method must be overriden if there is sub class are extend the abstract class.

OVERRIDE VS. IMPLEMENT
	- when an abstract method is overridden in a subclass, it is referred to as implementing the method
	- we tend to use the terms implement and override
	interchangeably for abstract methods, the term override
	is more accurate
	
	- you can declare new unchecked exceptions but not checked
	exceptions in the overridden method

DEFINING ABSTRACT METHODS
	- an abstract class can include all of the same
	members as a nonabstract class, including variables, static
	and instance methods, and inner classes.
	- also include constructors
	- not actually required to include any abstract methods
	
	* The abstract modifier cannot be placed after theclass keyword in a class declaration, nor after the return type
in a method declaratio

Constructors in Abstract Classes
	- Even though abstract classes cannot be instantiated, they are
still initialized through constructors by their subclasses. 

	** abstract classes are initialized with constructors in the same way as nonabstract classes
	if an abstract class does not provide a constructor, the
	compiler will automatically insert a default no-argument
	constructor
	
	** a constructor in abstract
		class can be called only when it is being initialized by a
		nonabstract subclass
		
Invalid Abstract Method Declarations
Invalid Modifiers
abstract and final Modifiers
	- neither the class or method declarations will 
	compile because they are marked both abstract and final.

abstract and private Modifiers
	- A method cannot be marked as both abstract and private
	
	**
	While it is not possible to declare a method abstract and
	private, it is possible (albeit redundant) to declare a
	method final and private
	
abstract and static Modifiers
	- static method cannot be overridden -> can not go with abstract
